> The Pope's Exorcist - *It gives me excitement while im watching this movie because of the suspense and thrill
that makes more excited. It contains about detours into a Vatican conspiracy plot that has been compared to Dan
Brown’s novels but half-assedly connects with church atrocities and scandals. It’s ultimately a theological action
flick with overtones of an old-fashioned Western about an aging gunslinger who teams up with an earnest but
untested younger partner to save women and children from a monstrous enemy.*
